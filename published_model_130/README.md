# 130 Optuna Trials - Current Best Model

## Overview
This directory contains the **best-performing model** from **130 Optuna trials** when optomised for all (6) metrics. It was trained using a **static 3-3-5 BRICS, SIDE CHAINS, and RINGS architecture** and is fully **compatible with the most up-to-date prediction scripts**.

## Key Details
- Trained using **130 Optuna trials** for hyperparameter tuning.
- Uses a **static 3-3-5 BRICS, SIDE CHAINS, and RINGS** feature architecture due to computational limitations.
- Fully **compatible with the latest prediction scripts**.
- A **new best model is planned for release** in the near future.

## Compatibility & Usage
**This model is compatible with the current prediction scripts.**

If using this model:
1. Ensure you are utilizing the most up-to-date scripts.
2. Note that while this is the **current best model**, an improved version is expected soon.

## Future Considerations
A **new best model** is in development and will be released soon.
